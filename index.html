      <p>“Aaron Gathrid was instrumental in getting our house ready and listed very quickly. He remained flexible and responsive to the market throughout the fall during a tricky market. He was proactive in staging the house for open houses continuously across multiple months. He provided great guidance to navigate the sale contingent offer, which progressed very smoothly. It was a new experience for us, and everything about working with Aaron, up until closing, was smooth—he had our backs every step of the way."<br>

His strategic approach and attention to detail gave me confidence. He navigated the complexities with ease, demonstrating a deep understanding of market trends, zoning regulations, and investment potential. I highly recommend him for both residential and commercial needs. He's a dedicated and effective realtor!

      <p>“Aaron Gathrid was a terrific representative of our interests and goals for this real estate purchase. We were lucky to find this property within a week of it being listed, and Aaron went to work immediately for us. He walked the property and visited the house multiple times with within a couple days, and facilitated all the necessary steps for us to be the first offer on this really unique property and house. Aaron saw immediately how the this place was a special fit for our hopes and dreams, and provided great guidance at each stage. During negotiations, Aaron helped find us responsive contractors to get estimates for work that would be needed, and he sought advice from his fellow agents, when needed. I would highly recommend Aaron to anyone seeking a kind, generous, intelligent, experienced, and thorough agent for any real estate purchase.”<br>

              Yes – I'm young, and no, I don't have 40 years of experience. And
              that's exactly why I might be the best person to represent you.
              Unlike many agents who rely on repeat business and coast on
              reputation, I'm building mine from the ground up — with energy,
              focus, and an uncompromising standard of service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every client matters deeply to me. I treat each transaction as if
              my career depends on it — because it does.
            </p>
            <p>
              Real estate runs deep in my roots. I grew up immersed in the world
              of design and construction as the son of a respected home designer
              and builder. From early on, I learned what makes a home not just
              beautiful, but valuable: timeless design, great location, and
              harmony with its surroundings. Those lessons shaped my approach
              and sharpened my eye as an agent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Licensed in Oregon and Idaho, I bring a fresh perspective and
              full-time commitment to buyers, sellers, and landowners across the
              Eugene area. I've chosen this work because I believe in it — in
              new chapters, in sound investments, and in the trust it takes to
              guide people through both.
            </p>
